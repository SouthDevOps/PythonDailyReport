Initial MR request for PythonDailyReport

Step 1: Project Structure
Ensure your project structure remains the same:

arduino
Copy code
test_report_app/
    app.py
    templates/
        report.html
        form.html
    static/
        styles.css
Step 2: Install Bootstrap
You can use Bootstrap via a CDN in your HTML files. No additional installation is required.

Step 3: Update the HTML Templates

Step 4: Optional Custom CSS
Create a custom CSS file (static/styles.css) to add any additional styling you prefer. For now, weâ€™ll keep it minimal, but feel free to customize it further.

Step 5: Update app.py
No changes are required in the app.py file if you have already set it up as described earlier.

Step 6: Running the Application
Run your application again:
python app.py

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the form, submit reports, and view them in a styled table.
